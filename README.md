This project aims to identify the concentration of XCo2(Column averaged Carbon Dioxide) for a large region based on the findings from the NASA OCO-2 satellite.
It also is a small step towards improving the accuracy in regions that are too small for which the concentration is measured, to improve said accuracy the concept of wisdom of crowds has been used in a analytical manner to overcome said hindarance.
This project was built on python using machine learning algorithm Random Forest.
To run this project install dependencies(packages) present in first few lines of the code.
